1453884781,com.risesci.nyx,rise: sleep tracker,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rise-sleep-tracker/id1453884781?uo=4,"Join over 10 million users! Become a better sleeper and morning person thanks to 100 years of sleep science with RISE, the only sleep tracker that also measures your sleep debt and energy levels.

Recommended by the Sleep Foundation and trusted by teams in the NFL, MLB, and NBA, and top Fortune 500 companies, RISE makes it easy to improve your sleep and energy.

But RISE is more than a sleep and energy tracker. Users can access widgets, calendar integration, sleeping sounds, meditation guides, smart alarm clocks, habit reminders, and a sleep knowledge library.

FROM THE RISE COMMUNITY

***
Chase M.
""RISE helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.""

***
Becky G.
""I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before RISE.""


UNLOCK BETTER SLEEP
Tired of the age-old ""eight hours of shut-eye"" advice? Go beyond buying a new mattress or pillow and discover the life-changing concept of Sleep Debt.

Scientifically proven to be a vital factor in your well-being, a low Sleep Debt can improve your life quality and even your longevity—while high Sleep Debt can cause fatigue and harm your health.

RISE calculates your Sleep Debt, helps you understand its impact on your energy, and guides you on how to lower it by improving sleeping habits. Learn about your melatonin window, when to prioritize sleep, and understand the real cost of those late nights—and how you can benefit from naps.

PERSONALIZED SLEEP TRACKER
Do you find your mind racing when your head hits the pillow? Can’t stop doom-scrolling on your phone? Feeling fatigued all day?

Based on your sleep data, circadian rhythm and research, we’ll make recommendations that fit your needs and guide you toward healthier habits.

RISE will get you in bed on time, guide you when you can’t sleep, reduce the times you wake up at night, and make you feel less groggy in the morning.

DISCOVER YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM
We all have an internal brain clock, our circadian rhythm, it signals to our body when to be alert or go into recovery mode. Everyone is unique, from when we perform our best to when we should sleep and wake up. We use advanced algorithms to find your optimal sleep windows.

You’ll gain insight into your circadian rhythm and energy levels, helping you plan for a productive day.

Sleeping refuels energy, and 83% of RISE users feel more energy in a week or less.

AUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP
Through our integration with Apple Health, Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura, and data from other sleep trackers on your phone, like Sleep Cycle and ShutEye, RISE can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, sleep debt, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other activities that affect your sleep pattern.

WHY WE STARTED RISE
We want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we're experiencing, which has been increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).

Today, we look at sleep as a luxury. RISE strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.
